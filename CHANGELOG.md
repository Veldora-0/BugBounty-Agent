## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-03

### Initial Release — BugBounty-Agent V1

#### Added
* **OpenCode Native Architecture**:
  * 14 specialized agents in `.opencode/agents/` led by `bb-hunter`.
  * 14 modular methodology skills in `.opencode/skills/`.
  * Project configuration in `opencode.jsonc` with granular permission model.
  * Hierarchical documentation in `AGENTS.md`.
* **Scope Engine**:
  * Exact domain, wildcard (`*.example.com`), URL prefix, and CIDR/IP evaluation.
  * Arbitrary-depth recursive subdomain evaluation with configurable `max_depth`.
  * DNS-label boundary verification preventing substring spoofing.
  * Strict precedence: Explicit Exclusion > Specific Inclusion > Recursive/Wildcard Inclusion > Ambiguous.
* **Persistent Research State**:
  * Machine-readable state for assets, endpoints, technologies, hypotheses, and tests.
  * Stable test fingerprinting to eliminate redundant scans.
  * Finding deduplication across root cause, endpoint, and vulnerability class.
* **Controlled CLI Layer**:
  * `bb-init`, `bb-scope-check`, `bb-target-normalize`, `bb-recon`, `bb-http`, `bb-content`, `bb-js`, `bb-api`, `bb-nuclei`, and `bb-evidence`.
  * Windows CMD shims for cross-platform execution.
* **Evidence Management**:
  * Cryptographic SHA-256 integrity hashing of HTTP interactions.
  * Automatic regex redaction of Bearer tokens, API keys, and session cookies.
* **Reporting**:
  * 17-section standard disclosure report generator.
* **Automated Test Suite**:
  * Unit and integration test coverage across scope, recursive depth, normalization, deduplication, finding lifecycle, and runtime isolation.
